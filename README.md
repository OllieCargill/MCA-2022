# Ollie Cargill's MCA Project: Medieval Music

## Week 1: Basics of Music Data
Some issues that can arise when working with medieval music and its data can be preservation and accessibility. Preservation is especially relevant to medieval music, particularly concerning access to manuscripts. Handwritten manuscripts from the medieval period can be fragile, tattered and often elusive due to deterioration over time. Solutions to this include good preservation practises which can mitigate further degradation, and restoration methods. Digitising the manuscripts is a solution for both preservation and accessibility, as in a digital form, the manuscripts are easier to analyse as there is no risk of damage to the original copy. In terms of accessibility, digitised manuscripts can be uploaded to an online archive and therefore can be widely accessible. Medieval music is presently curated in manuscript form in archives, museums and databases. These online archives and databases contain metadata about the manuscript (some of this metadata is estimated because information is lost through time) like place of writing, time period of production, the contents of the manuscript, the archive where the physical manuscript is held, the dimensions of the manuscripts and so on. The DIAMM (https://www.diamm.ac.uk/) (Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music) is an example of an online database for medieval music information and digitised manuscripts.

## Week 2: Notation Basics
Here is the link to a short segment of the sheet music for "Ave Maris Stella", a medieval hymn written in the 9th century.

I converted this from PDF format to MuseScore using Optical Music Recognition Software. I corrected a few mistakes that the OMR technology made when converting the PDF.
