## Week 3: Encoding Basics for Notation
For week 3's task, I exported this MuseScore file into MusicXML and MEI, and then rendered the MEI file using Verovio.
Here is the [MusicXML file](https://github.com/OllieCargill/MCA-2022/blob/master/Ave_Maris_Stella.musicxml")
This is the link to the rendered MEI file of Ave Maris Stella using Verovio - my answers to the week 3 questions are also on this page. [Week 3 Task](https://olliecargill.github.io/MCA-2022/verovio.html).
